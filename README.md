## How to Play / Gameplay Instructions

### RoboRally is played in rounds, each round consists of two phases:
- ### the programming phase
    - #### in the programming phase you draw cards from your deck and arrange them in your card register to plot your moves.
- ### the activation phase
    - #### in the activation phase your robot is activated, and it will carry out it's programming. During this phase the elements on the board will also be activated.

### Cards:
#### In Roborally there are quite a handful of cards the player is able to choose from. These cards are called programming cards and are used to move your robot during the activation phase. In addition, there are also damage cards, or spam cards, that will be added to your deck if your robot ends up taking damage.

## board elements:
#### There are multiple different board elements in Roborally. The elements only affect the player if the robot sits directly on at the end of the register.

### Antenna
#### The antenna is there to determine whose turn it is to move, it acts just like a wall.

### Lasers
#### Lasers can come from 1 to 3 lasers, when a player sits on a laser at the end of the register the player will gain 1-3 damage cards (spam cards) according to the amounts of lasers. The laser will have a wall in the back of it and the beam from the laser cannot go through walls or antenna.

### Gears
#### When a player sits on a gear the player with be rotated 90 degrees according to the gears arrows at the end of the register.

### Conveyor Belts
#### The conveyor belt can come it quite a few different forms, all of which can be read about in the games rules. The primary purpose of the conveyor belt is to move the player according to the arrows on that belt.

### Push Panels
#### The push panels work by pushing the player that is resting on it. The push panels will only push the player if the number on the push panel corresponds to the current register.

### Pits
#### Landing on a pit will reboot the player when the players land on it.

### Walls
#### Players are not able to move through walls and the walls are not able to be pushed.
